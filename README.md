# Academic Management & Geometry Toolkit (C++ CLI Project)

This is a console-based C++ project developed as part of coursework at the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology (PJATK). The application consists of two modules:

- **Geometry Toolkit** – handles 2D point operations
- **Student Record System** – simulates a basic academic database with student and grade management

It demonstrates key programming concepts such as structures, arrays, basic algorithms, and CLI-based CRUD logic.

## 🚀 Features

### 📐 Geometry Toolkit
- Define and display 2D Cartesian points
- Compute the distance between two points
- Check if three points form a valid triangle
- Identify the two most distant points in a given array

### 🎓 Student Record System
- Add, view, update, and delete student entries
- Assign subjects with ECTS and multiple grades
- Calculate ECTS-weighted GPA per student
- Promote students to the next semester (or mark as graduated)
- Display a GPA-based ranking of all students

## 🛠️ Technologies

- C++ (Standard Library)
- CLI (Command Line Interface)
- Procedural and structural programming

## 🎓 Academic Context

This project was implemented as part of **Lab 04 – Arrays and Structures** during the first year of Computer Science Engineering at PJATK Gdańsk.  
It focuses on practical use of:

- `struct` definitions
- Arrays and `std::vector`
- Function design
- Basic user interaction with `cin` / `cout`
